the fiscal policy which increases aggregate demand by increasing government expenditure or by lowering governmant tax is called Expansionary Fiscal Policy.

This type of fiscal policy is reflected in the government project. Due to the expansion of government spending and lowering of government tax, the expansionary fiscal policy either increases budget deficit or reduces the budget surplus. Such type of fiscal policy is practiced during economi depression. 



b) Contractionary Fiscal Policy
The fiscal policy which reduces aggregate demand either by reducing government expenditure or by increasing the governmant tax is called Contractionary fiscal policy. 

Due to the reduction in government expenditure and increase in tax , Contractionary fiscal policy results into either increased budget surplus or decreased budget deficit. 



Comparative Micro Analysis

It is he copmaprative study between different point of time. It means that comparative microstaatic analysis compares the equilibrium positions at different perios of time. 

In this way, comparative microanalysis compares equilibrium positions which occur due to change in microeconomic variables like demand or supply or both. It compares equilibrium positions but does not explai the process of how an initial equilibrium is disturbed and new equilibrium is achieved.It also does not involve the path and time through which new equilibrium in market is established. The concept of comparative micro analysis can be explained by the help of above figure in graph copy. In the figure above the upward slopping curve SS represents supply curve and downward slopping curve represents DD which is initial demand curve. These two curves are intersecting at point E, which is the initial equilibrium point. Therefore, initial equilibrium is OP and initial equilibrium quantity is OQ. Suppose that due to the favourable change in independent variables like income, the initial demand curve  shift rightward from DD to D1-D1. The new demand curve D1-D1 intersects the supply curve SS at pint E1 which is the new equilibrium point. Here, the new equilibrium price is OP1 and new equilibrium quantity is OQ1. The comparative study of these two equilibrium points is the comparative microstatic analysis. 




Dynamic Micro analysis

Micro Dynamic Analysis can be defined as the analysis of the process through which the system moves from one equilibrium to another. It means that micro dynamic analysis explains the lagged relationship between the micro economic variables. It is concerned mainly with the state of dis equilibrium rather than equilibrium and takes time factor into consideration.

It studies the models involving time and path by ehich new quantity extablishes.

It also provides answer to the causes of breaking initial equilibrium and establishing new equilibrium. 

Cobweb model can be used to explain the micro dynamic analysis as in graph.
In the figure, the downward slopping curve represents demand curve and upward slopping curve represents supply curve. These two curves are intersecting each other at point E. The point E is the initial equilibrium point which has determined OP equilibrium price and OQ equilibrium quantity. 

Suppose that the initial demand curve DD shift rightward to D!-D1 due to the favourable change in factor determining demand (income). As a result, new equilibrium point E1 is determined. Micro dynamic explains the process and path of how initial equilibrium pint E moves to new equilibrium point E1. At the beginning, when initial demand called DD shifts rightward to D1-D1, demand exceeds supply, which causes upward pressure on price. This process continues in different steps ABCD......................................................................................................................................................................................... until new equilibrium point E1 is attained. In this way, micro dynamic analysis shows the process of adjustment from one equilibrium to another breaking the initial equilibrium and establishing new equilibrium.



Types of macro economics
(a) Static Macro Analysis
(b)  Comparative Macro Analysis
(c) Dynamic Macro Analysis



 (a) Static
 It is the study of the finl position of equilibrium of the whole economy at a particular point of time. It shows a stationary picture of the whole economy and also invesigates the relation between macro eco variables in the final position of equilibrium. However, it does not tell the process of adjustment to the final equilibrium. The following equilibrium reflects final position in economy where Y =  NI or aggeragate output 

 A concept of macro static analysis can be expaline by the help of above figure. In the figure above x - axis represents national income whereas y -axis represents consumption and investment. Aggregate demand (AD) called (C+I) and aggregate supply curve (45 degree line) are intersected each other at point E. Therefore, ppoint E is the equilibrium point where the equilibrium level level of national income is determined OY. Since, aggregate demand AD and aggregate supply AS refer to the same point of time, it is macro static analysis.
